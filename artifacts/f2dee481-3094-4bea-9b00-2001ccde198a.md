# Technical Requirements Artifact

### Technical Specifications, Constraints, and System Requirements for the Ride-Hailing App

#### System Requirements

1. **Platform Support**
   - Mobile applications for Android (minimum API level 21) and iOS (minimum iOS 12.0).
   - Web application for user bookings and admin dashboard.

2. **User Interface (UI)**
   - Simple, intuitive UI for easy ride booking.
   - Responsive design to support multiple screen sizes (smartphones and tablets).

3. **Backend Infrastructure**
   - Server-side application running on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure).
   - RESTful API for communication between frontend and backend.
   - Database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) for user data, ride logs, driver details, etc.
   - Geo-spatial database for location-based services and mapping (e.g., PostgreSQL with PostGIS, MongoDB with Geospatial queries).

4. **Geolocation Services**
   - Integration with GPS services for real-time tracking (e.g., Google Maps API, Mapbox).
   - Algorithms for calculating distance and estimated fare based on traffic conditions and ride duration.

5. **Payment System Integration**
   - Support for multiple payment gateways (e.g., Razorpay, Paytm, UPI).
   - Secure handling of financial transactions with PCI-DSS compliance.

6. **Push Notifications**
   - Implementation of push notifications for ride status updates, promotions, and news.

7. **User Authentication**
   - User account creation with email/phone verification.
   - Driver verification process with background checks.

8. **Admin Dashboard**
   - Web interface for managing rides, drivers, and users.
   - Real-time analytics for monitoring operational metrics.

#### Constraints

1. **Data Privacy and Security**
   - Compliance with GDPR and Indiaâ€™s Personal Data Protection Bill (draft) for user data privacy.
   - Secure storage of user and payment data.

2. **Scalability**
   - The architecture should be designed to handle scalability for increasing user and driver demand.
   - Plan for transitioning from auto-rickshaws to cabs and bike taxis, ensuring that the app can adapt to new vehicle types without major refactoring.

3. **Performance**
   - Efficient processing of real-time data to provide quick fare estimates and ride availability.
   - Minimal latency in real-time tracking and updates.

4. **Network Connectivity**
   - Functionality must account for varied network connectivity in tier-2 and tier-3 cities in India, including offline capabilities or reduced functionality in low-connectivity areas.

5. **Cultural and Regional Factors**
   - Language support for multiple local languages to cater to the diverse user base.
   - Consideration of regional fare fluctuations and pricing models based on local economics.

6. **Safety Measures**
   - In-app features for emergency assistance and location sharing with trusted contacts.
   - Implement a driver rating and review system to maintain service quality.

#### Technical Specifications

- **Mobile App Specifications**
  - **Frontend Technologies**: 
    - Native (Java/Kotlin for Android, Swift for iOS) or cross-platform frameworks (React Native, Flutter).
  - **Backend Technologies**: 
    - Node.js, Python (Flask/Django), or Java (Spring Boot) for the server-side application.
  - **Cloud Services**: 
    - AWS Lambda for serverless functionalities, S3 for storage, and EC2 for computing.
  
- **APIs & Integrations**
  - **Map and Location Services**: Google Maps API, OpenStreetMap.
  - **Payment Processing**: Razorpay, Paytm SDKs.
  - **Push Notification Services**: FCM for Android and APNs for iOS.

- **Database Management**
  - ORM tools (e.g., SQLAlchemy for Python, Hibernate for Java) for efficient database interactions.
  
- **Development and Deployment Tools**
  - Git for version control, CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions or Jenkins.
  - Containerization using Docker for consistent deployment environments.

By aligning with these specifications, constraints, and system requirements, the app aims to provide a robust and user-friendly ride-hailing solution tailored to the unique challenges and opportunities present in tier-2 and tier-3 cities in India.
